                    On this page, you will find a table with all the records of the employees who have been entered into the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the table, you will find a calculate button. When pressed, this button will perform a calculation of the type of extra hours and how much will need to be paid. Following that, the total amount to be paid, excluding taxes, will be shown in the <strong>Gross Pay</strong> column.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the same <strong>Actions</strong> column, you will find another button that allows you to edit the employee's information in case it was entered incorrectly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, in this window where you can edit the data, you will find a red button that will allow you to delete that employee's record.
